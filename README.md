## What is Cythonic
Cythonic is a Programmer's created out of passion and love for programming. It's primary objective is to make its readers more knowledgable about the basics of programming and simply to spark interest within to further explore and learn coding.

## Why Cythonic ?
We are already living in a technological roller coaster and with the current conditions in the world, new digital tools and arenas are evolving faster than ever replacing and renovating traditional systems. Adapting to change is an emminent factor to succeed, yet most of the general public find themselves uncomfortable with communicating with programmable digital systems due to the lack of knowledge of Coding. Cythonic was created with the intention of breaking this barrier and to make to easier for anyone to enter into programming and build their journey successfully.

## About the author
I am Chathura Gunasekera, and I'm originally from the beautiful island of Sri Lanka. I am no expert in the field of computer science but I love learning computer science and applying it to automate daily, mundane tasks and make life more exciting and productive. This entire blog was created out of this passion for programming, not for any other reason what so ever. I strongly beleive that the best way to learn is to teach, and hence this is simply a humble effort to donate what knowledge I've gained in my journey as an aspiring programmer, and to gather knowledge in the process of doing so.
